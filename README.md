# Capstone

This repository is dedicated to compiling efforts and resources related to the Capstone Course Project as part of the Data Science program at George Washington University. The goal of this project is create a light weight solution to implementing Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) applications to conduct object detection in high-resolution satellite imagery.

This project will aim to develop a plugin for an open source Geospatial software programe called QGIS. The plugin will provide the capability to perform various object detection methods on high-resolution satellite imagery utlizing Deep Learning and CNN libraries and pre-trained models. 

The goal of this project is to develop a light weight solution to conducting object detection in the Geospial Analysis domain without requiring significant computing resources. The plugin being proposed will utlize existing methods in developing Neural Networks for image classification and segmentation to train a model in a less labor intensive fashion but also provide the option to utlize existing pre-trained models that may enhance model power.
